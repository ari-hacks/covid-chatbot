## Set up

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8.1
- A Twilio account - [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp)
- [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)


### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ari-hacks/covid-chatbot.git
cd covid-chatbot
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install chatterbot==1.0.4
pip3 install twilio 
pip3 install pytest 
pip3 install uvicorn    
pip3 install fastapi  
pip3 install nltk   
pip3 install httpx
pip3 install requests_mock         
```

4. Run the application

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload 

#uvicorn runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000    
```

5. Next we need to unzip the ngork [download](https://ngrok.com/download). Ngork creates a secure public tunnel for us to use when communicating with WhatsApp via the twilio API. From your terminal run the following command: 

```bash
./ngrok http 8000

#this port must match the app port
```
6. After you have created your [twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp) navigate to the [dashboard's sandbox](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/sandbox) in the field titled ` when a message comes in ` enter the generated forwarding address from your terminal and save. The forwarding url will look like this: 

![Alt text](/ngork_ex.png?raw=true "Demo")

7. Next follow these [ twilio instructions](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/learn) to connect your account to WhatsApp and send a message ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Tests

You can run the tests locally by typing:

```bash
pytest
```
### Troubleshooting
If you run into issues with nltk 

```bash
#error in terminal related to ssl verification
#solution - in the terminal run the following commands, make sure you change the version of python accordingly 
>>/Applications/Python 3.8/Install Certificates.command

>>Python3

>>Import nltk

>>nltk.download() 
```

### Cloud deployment

To try this application locally, you can deploy it to Heroku. 

```bash 
#check if app is running with this endpoint 
https://heroku-porject.herokuapp.com/twilio/health-check

#add this endpoint into your twilio snadbox
https://heroku-porject.herokuapp.com/twilio/bot
